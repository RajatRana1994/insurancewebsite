                            <p>There are many types of Supplemental Insurance, which is why it’s important to talk with an insurance representative from Defy Insurance to discuss your options. A couple of examples include additional insurance for Medicare and Maternity.</p>
                            <p><b>Medicare Supplemental</b> Insurance provides current individuals under Medicare with assistance for items not covered under Medicare Part A and Part B. This can include co-pays, deductibles, and co-insurance that can add up to large out-of-pocket expenses.</p>
                            <p><b>Maternity Supplemental</b> Insurance helps to cover any medical expenses up to the delivery of the baby. This can include deductibles, co-payments, and more – so you’re not stuck with unexpected expenses on top of your existing bills.</p>
                            <p>Since Supplemental Insurance is an addition to your Health Insurance policy, it’s important to note that it does not act as a traditional Health Insurance policy.</p>
                            <p>Avoid gaps in your current Health plan with Supplemental Insurance from Defy Insurance.</p>
