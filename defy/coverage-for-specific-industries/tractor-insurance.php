                            <p>Make sure your livelihood is protected. Everyone understands the importance of maintaining insurance on a car or a house, but if a tractor is part of your livelihood, it's a vital investment that should be covered against damage and loss.</p>
                            <p>Tractors are often vulnerable to the same issues as vehicles and homes, including weather, accidents, and mechanical wear and tear. In fact, many tractor owners have relied on insurance to deal with unfortunate situations such as theft, vandalism, burglary, and fires caused by lubricant leaks. Most of these issues are not caused by owner-operator error and could be covered by insurance.</p>

                            <p>As the owner of a farm or ranch, you understand better than most the significance of the phrase, "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." You also understand that your tractor is just as important to your daily operations as a car is to a salesperson or tools are to a contractor. Protecting your equipment now can mean the difference between feast and famine in the future.</p>
                            <p>Insurance helps make any crisis manageable, but the specific terms and conditions of tractor insurance can vary greatly from state to state. Call Defy Insurance to find out about the specifics of coverage in your area and how you can protect your assets. When you call, be sure to have the specific size and type of tractor you want to insure on hand, plus its main purpose and its value to your operation as a whole.</p>
