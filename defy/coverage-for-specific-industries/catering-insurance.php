                            <p>The catering business can involve a lot of risk. Caterers work on other businesses’ property and perhaps even in their kitchens, and rely on suppliers and other vendors to furnish the necessary items to provide food. With so much happening—between supplying food, preparing it, transporting it, and serving it to customers—much can unexpectedly go wrong. All of these variables put you at risk, so it is a good idea to make sure you are covered against possible problems with catering insurance.</p>

                            <div class="section-header">

                            </div>
                            <p>If you have employees, you need workers compensation coverage, and of course your own equipment should be covered. General liability coverage exists as well, to cover any damages you might cause (such as your heating units catching the building on fire).</p>
                            <p>If you serve alcoholic beverages you will need coverage for that as well, as there are more risks and exposure when alcoholic beverages are involved in to a business.</p>
                            <p>As a business owner, you will need coverage for yourself to take care of loses you might incur due to lost income. Mechanical breakdown, storms, and vehicle trouble are just a few things that could negatively affect your ability to render your catering services.</p>
                            <p>For a food services industry, liability is always a concern. Lawsuits arising from food poisoning (due to negligence or from mistakenly serving contaminated food) can cause a modest business with irreparable harm. A general small business liability policy will cover the basics, but there are other liabilities such as using a vehicle you don't own, having employees use those vehicles, and accidentally damaging property when providing your services.</p>
