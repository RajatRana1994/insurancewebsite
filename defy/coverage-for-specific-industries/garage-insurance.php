                            <p>Garage insurance protects businesses with garage facilities from all kinds of risks, such as injuries, property damage, and human mistakes. Without this insurance, a small business' reputation can be seriously tarnished and hard-earned money will go not to profits, but to payouts.</p>
                            <p>Garage liability insurance mostly applies to towing businesses and service stations that help protect customers' cars and trucks while they are serviced or held. For instance, if a customer's vehicle is damaged due to the business' negligence, the vehicle would be covered under a garage insurance policy.</p>
                            <p>Some of the more common kinds of garage insurance are:</p>

                            <p>Garage liability coverage is another insurance type available to small businesses. It provides liability coverage for any accidents that may happen as a result of your day-to-day garage operations. These accidents may result in bodily injury, personal injury or property damage.</p>
                            <p>A business owners’ policy (BOP) is an option small businesses have when looking into garage-related insurance. It is perfect for individuals who need a bit more than the basic liability because business owners’ policy (BOP) offers protection for incidents like identity theft coverage and loss of income.</p>
                            <p>Workers' compensation insurance covers medical costs, rehabilitation expenses and any lost wages an employee might experience after getting ill or injured on the job. It also provides financial support to the family of any garage employee who dies from a job-related injury or illness.</p>
                            <p>With all that garage insurance has to offer, many small auto-related businesses make the choice to purchase this valuable protection. You can do it, too.
