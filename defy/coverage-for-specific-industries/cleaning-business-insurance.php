                            <p>When you own a cleaning business, you do more than just clean. Special challenges abound, including the potential for liability or exposure in your business. Business insurance can be a little more complicated for cleaning companies than it is for other businesses because of increased liability exposure.</p>

                            <p>Business insurance can cover more than just equipment; it also can cover lost time due to mechanical failures, power outages, and other unforeseen difficulties that are out of your control. Consider also workers compensation insurance, should an employee be injured on the job.</p>
                            <p>Another area of potential liability is if you or one of your employees cause damage to a clientâ€™s property or other people. Most cleaning operations involve being on property belonging to your clients, so your employees face the risk of damaging client property or causing injury and being held liable for that damage. A wet floor, for example, could expose your firm to liability if someone falls and is injured as a result of your cleaning work.</p>
                            <p>Having an insurance agent who knows the ins and outs of business liability coverage is crucial for your peace of mind. Insurance rules also vary greatly between states, so you need an agent familiar with the geographic area you service to make sure you have the most appropriate cleaning business insurance. Consider, too, if you work in more than one state, how that will affect your insurance needs.</p>
