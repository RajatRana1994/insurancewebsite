                                    <li>Alcohol, Tobacco, some medicines, and any illegal drugs</li>

                            <p>If you plan to ship anything excluded from cargo insurance, it may be covered by another policy (especially if you own the items in question). Otherwise, you can talk to one of our agents about alternatives for cargo insurance and freight insurance that can actually cover the transportation of high-risk items.</p>

                            </div>
                            <p>Your shipping volume is a major factor in finding just how much insurance you need. In 2014, there were over 400,000 collisions involving large trucks, which comes out to over 1100 collisions every single day. The majority of these incidents are not the fault of the commercial truck driver, but the simple truth of the matter is that they do occur on a regular basis.</p>
                            <p>It's also important to note that collisions are not the only forms of loss—theft is a major problem in some areas, and average losses approach a quarter-million dollars per incident.</p>
                            <p>Larger trucking companies require more insurance in case there are problems with multiple vehicles, such as thefts from multiple trucks parked in one place. Even smaller companies are at risk, though, making cargo insurance and freight insurance one of the most important defenses of any hauling company.</p>
