                            <p>Real estate agents understand that homeowners must have property insurance in order to protect their greatest investment; but so, too, must realtors. Not only is an office (whether at home or at a commercial location) a large investment, but for most realtors itâ€™s also their most profitable one. Protecting that endeavor with the right commercial property insurance policy is vital to staying in business over the years. If the real estate office is in a flood zone, then a realtor might consider also adding flood insurance to cover relevant claims since they are excluded from commercial property insurance.</p>

                            <p> Another way to protect your income as a realtor is to invest in business continuation insurance, which will replace lost income should your business be forced to shut down due to one of the hazards listed in the policy. Additionally, this policy can cover the expenses of a temporary relocation, which will allow you to keep your business running for little to no extra cost as your office is being repaired or rebuilt.</p>

                            <p>Auto insurance is extremely important for realtors because of the nature of their job. Securing insurance that guards against the cost of both bodily injury and personal property damage liabilities as well as protecting your vehicle is a great way to minimizing your overall business expenses.</p>

                            <p>                                While there are many different types of liability insurance that realtors should consider, one of the most important is errors and omissions insurance. E&O is a professional liability policy that will cover the cost of defending a lawsuit or paying a claim that results from an accidental error or omission made by the realtor. This can include discrepancies in posted home listings, problems with contracts, errors in submitted bids and accidental misrepresentation of property qualities.</p>
