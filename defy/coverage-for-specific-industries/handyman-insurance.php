                            </div>
                            <p>As a handyman, you're the person who fixes items when they break. Your job is to help others, but even with the best of intentions, mistakes can happen that but your business on hold, potentially allowing competitors to step in and take your customers if you're out of business for too long.</p>
                            <p>If you don't have insurance yet, you may be wondering how much you need, and for what scenarios this insurance can be used. Experts agree that you should get insurance as soon as you can afford it, and to make sure you get enough of it to cover your risksâ€”the minimum amount for a policy is often not enough for proper protection. Defy Insurance's goal is to make sure the coverage you receive is affordable and right for your circumstances, and we'll work with you to find a plan that meets your needs.</p>
                            <p>When handymen perform repairs or contracting jobs on homes or apartments, it's important for their customers and their business that the work be done well. Many contractor's policies operate on a job-by-job basis, which only covers individual jobs for their duration, so any problems that occur during maintenance or construction are covered. However, you may also want to obtain completed operations liability coverage, which will help you with any claims that arise after your job is done.</p>
                            <p>While some policies only cover individual jobs, you can also purchase plans that insure the crucial elements of your small business.</p>

                            <p>Your work isn't all that needs to be protected. Equipment is the heart of your business, and while you might not be worried about insuring a single hammer or crowbar, imagine how much it would cost to replace all of your tools were if they were destroyed by fire or other accident. They'd have to be replaced before you could even start working again, and the price tag could quickly climb into the thousands of dollars if you use several specialty tools.</p>
