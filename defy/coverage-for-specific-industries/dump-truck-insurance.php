                            <p>If a dump truck is part of your business operation, you understand the importance of insurance for that vehicle. All vehicles need to be insured, of course, but dump truck insurance can make sure you are covered from unique issues related only to a dump truck.</p>
                            <p>Defy Insurance agents can help you with basic insurance on the vehicle itself that protects from standard risks, but dump trucks are also vulnerable to the following hazards, and require additional insurance:</p>

                            <p>If you have employees operating your dump truck, you need workers compensation insurance. If someone is injured while working, you want them to be covered, as required by law.</p>
                            <p>Consider, too, liability. Your truck could get into an accident, and most policies cover that. However, you may also be working on another person's property and may need liability insurance to protect you if your truck has an accident and causes personal or property damage. In those cases, it is not just lost operating time that matters; you could be facing a lawsuit.</p>
                            <p>Defy Insurance agents are familiar with the differences between state insurance regulations and requirements, and can assist you even if you work in more than one state.</p>
                            <p>Call Defy Insurance to make sure you are covered and that you can handle any crisis that develops. Our professional staff can make sure you have the best possible dump truck insurance. When you call, have the following information available:</p>
