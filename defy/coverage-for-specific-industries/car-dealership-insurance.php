                                <ul class="list-unstyled common-list">
                                    <li>The risk of vehicles being stolen from a lot</li>
                                    <li>Loss of inventory from natural causes (weather, disasters, etc.)</li>

                                    <li>Rental vehicles (especially those loaned to customers while their vehicle is in the shop) being damaged or destroyed</li>

                            <p>None of these costs are minor—the bill for each damaged or lost vehicle can start in the thousands of dollars and can climb rapidly from there. Car dealership insurance offers reimbursement for these expenses when they occur, allowing you to cover your losses and continue operating your business. Many dealerships have already seen the value of this coverage when something goes wrong—especially when the problem was neither foreseeable nor preventable.</p>
