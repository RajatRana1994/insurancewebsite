                            <p>Snow plows provide a vital service in places where snow can accumulate enough to block the roads. Whether helping the average employee get to work or allowing emergency services to reach people who badly need help, snow plowing is near the top of many cities’ necessary services during the winter months.</p>
                            <p>Snow plows face a particular set of vulnerabilities that most other vehicles don't. Aside from needing to head out onto slick surfaces (which is dangerous enough by itself), plows have to deal with problems like threats hidden beneath the snow, wear and tear from pushing snow aside, and the increased likelihood of collisions with other vehicles.</p>

                            <p>As the owner of a snow plow business, you're trying to help your community—and any interruption in your ability to plow snow, like damage to a vehicle or plow, could leave you scrambling to find replacement services and leave your company without any contracts. Snow plow insurance can help cover costs and ensure that you can get back to work as soon as possible. This type of coverage is so important that some areas actually require you to have it before you can apply for a permit to operate your plow on a commercial basis.</p>
                            <p> Defy Insurance agents are always available to advise you on snow plow insurance, including making sure you are properly covered during active plowing months, and aren’t paying for coverages you don’t need in the summer. For example, maintain comprehensive coverage on your vehicle and plow all year, so that it’s protected even if damage occurs in storage, but reconsider at other parts of your policy, like liability, when the plow is not being driven.
