                            <p>As a driver, safety should be one of your top concerns – safety for your passengers and for other drivers on the road. When you find the right coverage with Defy Insurance, you’ll learn that being a responsible driver has its benefits. With a Diminishing Deductible, you can actually get rewarded for being an accident and violation-free driver.</p>
                            <p>With Condo Insurance from Defy Insurance, you can extend your protection past that of what your condo community provides. It helps pay for the replacement of your personal belongings while offering basic liability to cover bodily injury or property damage. And unlike Renters Insurance, Condo Owners Insurance covers any damage done to the interior of your unit. For any interior damage, your insurance may be used to pay for the expense of fixing or replacing items like drywall, flooring, light fixtures, and more.</p>
                            <p>A Condominium Insurance policy includes other great features like guest medical protection, which pays for the medical expenses of friends and visitors who are injured on your property. In the event a fire or other disaster puts your condo out of commission, additional living expenses coverage may reimburse you for cost of temporary housing while your unit is being fixed.</p>
                            <p>Contact a specialist at Defy Insurance today to determine the right amount of coverage you need to keep your condo insured.</p>
