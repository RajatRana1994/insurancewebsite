                            <p>There are many additional coverage types that are available to safeguard your home and belongings, and it’s important to talk with a representative from Defy Insurance who can help you find the right policy.</p>
                            <p>Options such as Personal Property Insurance and Flood or Earthquake Insurance may not fall under a standard Homeowners policy. In the event of an accident or theft, Personal Property can pay the actual cash value or replacement cost of personal content items or articles like furniture, appliances, and clothing.</p>
                            <p>Other items that may be included are Builder’s Risk while your home is being built or reconstructed, and insurance for damage to pertinent/detached structures.</p>
                            <p>Another important feature to consider in your Homeowners policy is Dwelling Replacement Coverage. If a fire or other accident leaves your home a “total loss,” this coverage provides for the cost of replacing your home at its current value, rebuilding to code, and Ordinance & Law.</p>
                            <p>As is the case with many other features of Home Insurance, additional coverage can vary greatly depending on your policy, which is why it’s important to discuss your individual insurance options with Defy Insurance before making a decision.</p>
