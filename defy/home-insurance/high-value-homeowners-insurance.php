                            <p>A home symbolizes family, comfort, and security. It serves as a reflection of the individuals residing within its confines – from the exterior framework to the interior atmosphere. However, a home also symbolizes an investment. For homeowners in Woodbridge and the surrounding communities, this investment may exceed the value insured under a standard homeowners policy.</p>

                            <p>As an independent agency, we have the ability to truly put clients first and we have strong relationships with a collection of established carriers and underwriters. After consulting with clients, we turn to providers for the best policy forms and price. Often, our clients are able to bundle their coverage for additional savings.</p>
                            <p>Homeowners insurance tailored for high net worth clientele contains all the coverage offered under a traditional homeowners policy. However, the difference resides within the supplementary security supplied. A high value homeowners policy can ensure your home is rebuilt to its previous state or uncapped value – if extensive damaged occurs.</p>
                            <p>For your personal belongings, a traditional homeowners policy caps coverage for a variety of items, including jewelry, furs, and fine arts. This isn’t sufficient if the value of your belongings exceeds the coverage limits. Agents may recommend purchasing additional endorsements for these high-value items; however, through high value homeowners insurance, you can secure all items without the inefficiency of endorsements.</p>
                            <p>For more information on the insurance products and services we provide, please contact us at your convenience.</p>
