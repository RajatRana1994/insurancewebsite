                            <p>Offering a retirement plan for your employees could be one of the best things you'll do for your small business. The benefits aren't just in the future, either—as pointed out by the Department of Labor, starting a retirement plan offers immediate tax benefits in the form of deductibles, deferred taxation, and tax-free growth. Small employers can also usually take advantage of available tax credits that help offset the creation and administration of their plan, making it both easy and affordable to get started.</p>

                            <p>A 401(k) plan—named after its designation by the IRS—is a special type of retirement account that allows employees to contribute some of their earnings into a savings plan. The three main forms of 401(k) plans available are Safe Harbor, Automatic Enrollment, and Traditional, all of which have important differences for small businesses. We encourage talking to a certified financial professional prior to selecting a plan in order to ensure that it's right for your company's needs, both now and in the future.</p>

                            <p>If your company's income is variable, you can opt for what's known as a "profit sharing plan." These plans accept contributions at the discretion of employers, and typically do not require a certain amount of contributions each year. This is especially useful for startups, who may not have funds to spare as they work to establish themselves and deal with the challenges of creating a new business.</p>
                            <p>While all plans are required to file a Form 5500 each year to report their performance, the plans are accepted for businesses of any size and can even be used by companies that have other retirement plans in place. A Defy Insurance agents would be happy to discuss these and other options with you.</p>
                            <p>Guarantees and protections are subject to the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance company.</p>
