                                <p>An IRA is an account in which individuals set aside money each year that builds over time. The two main types of IRAs are: Traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs.</p>
                            </div>
                            <p>Traditional IRAs are tax-deferred accounts where any contributions you make may be tax-deductible. Once you withdrawal from your account after age 59 1/2, your earnings are then taxed. You can use your funds to purchase stocks, bonds, and other types of investments.</p>
                            <p>Roth IRAs are similar to Traditional IRAs, except your contributions are not tax-deductible. Whenever you choose to withdrawal your earnings, you do not have to wait until age 50 1/2, and you are not taxed. You can also use your funds to purchase stocks, bonds, and other types of investments.</p>
                            <p>Other kinds of IRAs including Rollover IRAs, Inherited IRAs, and more are available based on your individual needs, and qualifications do apply.</p>
