                            <p>Defy Insurance offers several different coverage options for your consideration including&nbsp;<strong>term life,&nbsp;whole life, and more</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>Term Life – </strong>This is typically the simplest and least expensive insurance option. Term life insurance provides coverage at a fixed rate for a specified period of time. It’s a benefit policy that’s used primarily to cover financial responsibilities of the insured, with the benefit to be paid only if the insured were to die during the specified term. Most term life policies can be converted to a more permanent insurance solution such as whole life or universal life insurance. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>There are two types of term life insurance:&nbsp;</p>
                            <div class="card list-card">
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Annual Renewable Term</strong> is purchased for a period of one year, with the death benefit to be paid only if the insured were to die during that one-year term, along with the option to renew after the term period.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Level Term Life</strong> guarantees a fixed premium for a given period of time, usually in terms of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Your premium is based on your age and coverage options, with longer terms being more expensive.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                            <p><strong>Whole Life</strong> – As the most common type of permanent insurance, a whole life policy guarantees a death benefit for the lifetime of the insured as well as a cash value account for savings. Your premium remains constant throughout the duration of policy while payments over and above your premium are credited to your savings, which earn a fixed rate of interest.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p>There are many things to take into account when purchasing life insurance, and changes in your life situation can reflect changes in your insurance requirements. That’s why it’s important to carefully consider the different policy options and ensure that you have the right solution to meet your long-term life insurance needs.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>An insurance specialist with Defy Insurance will review your current life insurance situation and help you design a policy to plan for the future. </p>

                            <p>As your personal situations change (i.e., marriage, birth of a child or job promotion), so will your life insurance needs. Care should be taken to ensure this product is suitable for your long-term life insurance needs. You should weigh any associated costs before making a purchase. Life insurance has fees and charges associated with it that include costs of insurance that vary with such characteristics of the insured as gender, health and age, and has additional charges for riders that customize a policy to fit your individual needs.</p>
