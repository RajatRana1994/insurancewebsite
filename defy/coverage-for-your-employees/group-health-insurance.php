                            <p>Group health insurance plans typically include either indemnity plans, such as Fee-for-Service (FFS), or managed care plans, including: Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), Preferred Provider Organization (PPO), and Point-of Service (POS).</p>

                            <p>    The major difference between Indemnity and managed care plans is the types of providers, choices of doctors and physicians, out of pocket expenses, and medical bill payments.</p>

                            <p> Since group health insurance options vary from state to state in coverage options and benefits, as well as the size of your business, it’s important to discuss your business’s Health Insurance needs with a specialist at Defy Insurance who can help you find a solution that’s ideal and feasible for you and your employees.</p>
