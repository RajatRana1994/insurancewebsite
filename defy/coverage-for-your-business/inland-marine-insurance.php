                            <h3>What Inland Marine Can Do for Your Business</h3>
                            <p>No matter what business you’re in, an accident can happen at any time. That’s why it’s important to have an Inland Marine policy from Defy Insurance to provide your business with the appropriate coverage it needs during transit.</p>
                            <p>Since Inland Marine covers items outside of your standard Business Property Insurance policy, having additional coverage to keep your equipment insured off-site is critical. This coverage can also extend to protect your business’s goods or equipment when transported by ocean and air, also known as Ocean Marine.</p>
                            <p>Contact an Inland Marine specialist at Defy Insurance today to find out how your business can insure its most valuable assets while working or traveling off-site.</p>
