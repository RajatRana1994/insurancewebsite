                            <p>As a business owner, keeping your business insured is one of the most important financial decisions you can make. But if you don’t have a sufficient amount of coverage, your current policy may not have the extra layer of protection needed for situations that can jeopardize your finances, or even your operations.</p>

                            <p>  With Commercial Umbrella Insurance from Defy Insurance, you can protect your business and your assets in the event that your company gets sued in a major lawsuit.</p>

                            <p>A Commercial Umbrella policy will provide your business with additional coverage should a lawsuit or major accident exceed the limits of your existing, or underlying, General, Auto, or other business liability policy. It can also insure an incident that occurs outside of your coverage territory.</p>
