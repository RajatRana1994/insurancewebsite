                            <p>Errors and omissions refer to mistakes, negligence, or discrepancies in a business’s accounting records, which can possibly be interpreted as fraud and lead to legal action. Business owners and executives have several legal and financial responsibilities that accompany their roles, and if they fail to fulfill these responsibilities by inaccurately reporting income, errors and omissions insurance will reimburse a business for problems arising from these fiduciary oversights.</p>
                            <p>As a business owner, you know how important it is to live up to your promises. Consumer trust is a key part of earning repeat business, which in turn helps to create a stronger, healthier, and more profitable company.</p>
                            <p>Errors and omissions claims have been trending higher in recent years, with multipleâ€‘million dollar lawsuits being filed more frequently than ever before. Accordingly, most businesses need to have appropriate coverage amounts to be sure they're protected if a large claim is filed.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Claims and Damages:</strong> These are one of the major sources of potential loss that your company faces. E&amp;O protection on claims can reimburse you for any payouts you may have to make as a result of such claims being filed.</li>
