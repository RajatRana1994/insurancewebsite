                            <p>Transportation insurance covers a wide array of business transportation needs. If you are in the transportation business, you understand the importance of having your vehicles in running condition and protecting yourself from losses caused by accidents and natural disasters. While some companies are in the transportation business, transportation is, for others, only a part of the overall picture of the business. Even companies with minimal transportation needs should invest in insuring both the goods they convey and the means of that conveyance.</p>

                            <p>Whether you ship goods by road, air, or sea, or are in the towing business, you need insurance for unexpected events that create problems for your business. The goods you transport could get damaged despite your efforts to pack them properly. Your vehicle could be involved in an accident through no fault of your own. And while the vehicle itself may be insured, that does not guarantee the contents—or materials you are shipping—are covered.</p>
                            <p>So whether you have a fleet of vehicles or just one truck you use to haul items as a part of the whole business, the principle is the same. Adequate insurance allows you to continue business as usual if something bad happens.</p>
                            <p>Contact our office today and find out what we can do to help you with your transportation insurance needs. If you are an existing customer, we can review your policy to make sure you have complete coverage and your coverage is up to date. If you are a new customer, Defy Insurance can provide the transportation insurance coverage you need to protect your business.</p>
