                            <p>When you own your own business, it's important to protect your equipment and keep it safe. Obviously, without functioning equipment you lose money and business. This is why it is so important to have your equipment insured. While most business owners see the need for basic insurance, many don't think about mechanical breakdown insurance and all its variables. Including coverage for mechanical breakdowns in your policy helps secure your overall business insurance package by guarding against costly repairs.</p>

                            <p>Mechanical breakdown insurance can cover lost income due to mechanical breakdowns that happen in your business, including losses due to faulty machinery and vehicles. It is also important to make sure your insurance covers liability. When a mechanical breakdown occurs with your equipment, an employee or customer could be injured. There are many policies that can be applied to various business risks that involve the possibility for mechanical breakdowns and their effects. Defy Insurance agents are more than happy to speak to you about your options.</p>
                            <p>Businesses may also encounter liability issues if an employee or member of the public is injured due to a breakdown. Liability coverage is also essential, especially if you use equipment such as lawn mowers or hazardous construction equipment, or work in precarious locations like scaffolding or rooftops, where an employee or a member of the public could be injured. When you are working on another person's property or business, your personal liability risk increases as well as your liability for damaged property.</p>
                            <p>Insurance rules vary from state to state and it is important to have an insurance agent that understands these differences. If you work in more than one state, you may need additional coverage. We can help you determine whether or not additional licensure or coverage is necessary.</p>
                            <p>Call our office to find out how you can be completely covered in the event of a mechanical breakdown. We can help you make sure you have the best possible coverage, including liability that could result from a breakdown. If you are an existing customer, call our office to get an insurance tune-up to make sure your mechanical breakdown insurance policy is up to date.</p>
