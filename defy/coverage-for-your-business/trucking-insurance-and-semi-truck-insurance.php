                            <p>Trucks are the working vehicles of the automotive industry, designed to provide all the power needed to get things from one place to another. There are literally millions of trucks on the nation's roads, and while they're critical to our economy, even the safest trucks represent a serious risk for the companies operating them. Large trucks are involved in hundreds of thousands of collisions each year, which means that every single truck has a genuinely high chance of needing to file a claim.</p>

                            <p>This is where trucking insurance comes in. Whether you're hauling a few supplies between work sites or shipping products across the entire country, trucking insurance can ensure that you get the support you need in case something goes wrong.</p>

                            <p>Defy Insurance agents will work with you to determine what the limit on your policy should be. Different trucking companies have different needs, but whenever we start a policy, there’s only one trucking company whose needs we’re focused on meeting: yours. Whether you're just now starting your company or looking for a better rate now that your company has grown, our agents are ready to assist you in any way they can.</p>

                            <p>Semi-trucks are a special category when it comes to insurance. These vehicles face two major threats when they're out on the roads—collision (as we described above) and theft. Reports have noted that theft is becoming increasingly professional in nature, and the average loss is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. If you have several trucks robbed at the same time, it's not hard to see how quickly those losses could put you out of business.</p>
                            <p>Our semi-truck insurance policies are designed to meet these changing threats and provide you with the support you need if something goes wrong. We'll work with you to get incidents resolved as quickly as possible so that your truck can get back on the road—most trucking companies don't have spare vehicles sitting around, and we know how important it is for you to keep your fleet in top condition at all times.</p>
                            <p>For more information about these policies, call a Defy Insurance agents today and ask for a quote. Be sure to have information about your existing business on-hand, including what type of products you're shipping, how many trucks your company owns, what models they are, and how far they typically travel. This will help us find the policy that's most affordable for you and still meets all of your insurance needs.</p>
