                            <p>AWhen it comes to the safety and security of you and your family, nothing should be left to chance. If you or your loved ones get involved in a car accident, your number one priority should be to make sure everyone receives the care and treatment they need – at a cost that keeps your finances and savings intact.</p>
                            <p>Being insured with an auto policy that includes covering Medical Payments ensures that most medical expenses will be taken care of if you or a family member is injured in an auto accident as either a passenger in the car, or as a pedestrian struck by an auto. This coverage applies the same regardless of who is at fault and extends to the policyholder’s family members, as well as any passengers in the vehicle.</p>
                            <p>The rising cost of healthcare has made paying out of pocket for major medical expenses extremely difficult. If you worry about not being able to take care of your family in the event of an accident, keep in mind that with the right Auto Insurance policy, you won’t have to anymore.</p>
                            <p>Contact Defy Insurance today to learn about how the right coverage can keep those you care about most protected.</p>
