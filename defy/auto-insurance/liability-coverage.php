                        <p>if an accident happens, having the right amount of insurance can benefit you personally, financially, and legally. With Liability Coverage, you can be insured if you’re held responsible for a car accident by having any medical payments for injuries sustained to drivers, passengers, and pedestrians, as well as bills for property damage covered. If you become legally liable as a result of a collision, liability also helps to pay for legal defense costs if you get sued.</p>
