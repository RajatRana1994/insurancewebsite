                        <p>Unfortunately, there are those on the road who don’t share the same safety precautions as you, and if you’re involved in an accident with a motorist without the right coverage, you may have to take care of any medical payments, damages, or any other expenses with money from your own pocket.</p>

                        <p>Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage gives you the assurance you need knowing that your medical expenses will be covered. In cases where the driver at fault does not have adequate liability to pay for your injuries and damages, you’ll be compensated for the amount in which you are legally entitled to – in regards to you, your passengers, and your vehicle. Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Protection may also take care of property damage in some states.</p>
                        <p>Since Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage is a separate purchase from your typical Auto Insurance policy, it’s important to contact Defy Insurance to find out how you can be prepared for any situation on the road.</p>
