                        <p>Health Insurance might be the most significant sort of protection you can have. That is on the
						grounds that it influences a bigger number of territories than simply your wellbeing and it can
						likewise influence your monetary main concern. Visiting the doctor regularly can destroy your
						accounts. Medical coverage doesn’t simply assist you with paying for care, it can secure you and
						your family monetarily in case of unexpected and expensive injuries or illness. Unpredictable
						expenses can come up from anywhere and drive you insane. You would prefer not to be in the
						situation of including ‘cash worry’ to an effectively distressing clinical circumstance.</p>

								<div id="faq_01" class="card-body collapse" data-parent="#accordion">
                                    <p>When you have health insurance, many of your expenses are paid when you receive preventive
									care services, such as yearly checkups and regular screening tests. Many medical providers and
									health plans will even remind you when you need preventive care. It is important because
									preventive care often makes it possible to identify any health concerns early, when there is
									plenty of time to treat the concerns and preserve your good health.</p>     
                                    <p>Health insurance can shield you from overwhelming financial strain, too. While medical
									providers keep costs down as much as possible, they are not able to completely eliminate high
									medical bills, especially with major illnesses or in the event of an emergency. If you have health
									insurance, you will have a great deal of assistance with covering your medical bills.</p>     
                                    <p>These two benefits—greater control over personal health and fewer medical expenses—are also
									offered to your family when they are a covered dependent under your health plan.</p>     
                                </div>

								<div id="faq_02" class="card-body collapse" data-parent="#accordion">
                                    <p>When you purchase a health insurance plan, you will pay a premium, which is a fixed monthly
									amount, much like you pay for car or life insurance.  The premium is determined by the type of
									plan you have, as well as your age, your geographical location, and whether or not you use
									tobacco products.  In addition, you may have to pay deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance
									amounts when you see your doctor or buy prescription drugs.</p>    
                                    <p>Generally, you will pay higher premiums for plans that include out-of-network benefits; plans
									that have low or no deductible, copayment, or coinsurance amounts; or both.  You can choose
									to lower your monthly premium by purchasing a plan with a higher deductible. The type of plan
									you purchase should be determined by your anticipated health needs.</p>

								<div id="faq_03" class="card-body collapse" data-parent="#accordion">
                                    <p>Health insurance is tax deductible if you are self-employed or have a health savings account. If
									you are self-employed, the premiums that you pay for health insurance for yourself and your
									dependent can be deducted from your taxes. If your dependents are covered under another
									insurance plan, you cannot deduct that premium.</p>    
                                    <p>A health savings account (or HSA) is used in conjunction with a high deductible health plan. You
									typically must buy these plans from an employer, although they are also offered through private
									insurance companies. Any amount of money that you contribute to your HSA account, up to a
									certain limit, is tax deductible.</p>
